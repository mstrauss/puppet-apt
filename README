This module is based on camptocamp's version: https://github.com/camptocamp/puppet-apt, commit 5ce178ca8aa0e8712a4aa5d37a76e7125383eee2

It has received the following updates:
* Fully parameterized class(es)
* No more includes (they are evil)
* Reverted back to class/definition autoloading, I like that much better than importing *.pp
* Added cron-apt as a method to automatically keep your Debian system up-to-date
  * unattended-upgrade is still available too, but i do not recommend that: it
    does only security updates, it has too many bugs

Example Usage:
  class { 'apt': autoupdate => true, autoupdate_method => 'cron-apt' }

Dependencies:
  https://github.com/mstrauss/puppet-editfile

I have this module is in regular use with
* Debian Squeeze
* Debian Lenny
* (no Ubuntus)
